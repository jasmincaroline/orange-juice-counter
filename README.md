# üçä Orange Juice Tracker

A *simple and fun tracker* to help you monitor your **weekly orange juice consumption** and stay hydrated and healthy!

---

## üéØ The Goal

The objective is to drink **1 liter (1000 ml)** of orange juice per week.

This application visualizes your progress, where each small cup represents **250 ml** of your weekly goal.

## ‚ú® How It Works

1.  The page displays a **main cup** representing the 1-liter goal.
2.  You **click** on the small cups (each one marked **250 ml**) to register that you've had a glass.
3.  As you click, the main cup starts to **fill up**, visually representing your progress.
4.  The text below the main cup shows the **amount remaining** to hit the goal and the percentage already consumed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The project is built using **core web technologies**:

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the page.
* **CSS3** (in `style.css`): To style the main cup, the small cups, and the filling animations.
* **JavaScript** (in `script.js`): For the tracking logic: handling clicks, calculating the progress in liters/percentage, and dynamically updating the visuals.
